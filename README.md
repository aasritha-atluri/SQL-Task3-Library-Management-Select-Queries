# SQL-Task3-Library-Management-Select-Queries
This repository contains the SQL script for **Task 3** of the SQL Developer Internship.  
It demonstrates how to use `SELECT` queries in the **Library Management System** database.

## Prerequisite
Before running this script, please make sure you have already created the tables from **Task 1**.  
You can find them here: [Library-Management-Schema](https://github.com/aasritha-atluri/Library-Management-Schema) and and also inserted data from **Task 2**.

## What is Covered
1. **SELECT***
   - Display all columns from a table.
2. **SELECT specific columns**
   - Example: name and email from the Member table.
3. **Filtering data**
   - Using `WHERE`, `AND`, `OR`, `LIKE`, and `BETWEEN`.
4. **Sorting results**
   - Using `ORDER BY` in ascending and descending order.
5. **Limiting results**
   - Using `LIMIT` to return only a certain number of rows.

## Files
* **task3.sql** - SQL script containing all the queries for Task 3.
* **README.md** - Documentation.

## How to Run
1. Open MySQL Workbench, CLI, or an online compiler like [OneCompiler](https://onecompiler.com/mysql).  
2. Make sure you first run the schema from Task 1 and insert sample data from Task 2.  
3. Run the script **task3.sql** from this repository.  
4. Verify results using the `SELECT` queries included in the script.
